<h1>My relationship with computers and startups.</h1>

Windows 98, equipped white unbreakable cabinet machine, LG Studioworks CRT monitor, and Asus’ trackball PS/2 mouse, still remind me of when my father bought me my first computer in the year 2000. I used to **dial up to establish an internet connection** in 2003. Well, my relationship with computers is that old. I was destined to share sides with computers throughout my life. I have been exploring and tinkering with computers.  

After completing my graduation in Computer Science, I opted for startups as my go-to learning option, as I wanted to avoid the monotony of traditional jobs. Even though 95% of startups fail, I wanted to be part of the startup’s product-market fit journey. Hence I joined right after college.  

Working mostly in early-stage environments, I have gained valuable experience in leading small teams, establishing structures, and navigating high degrees of uncertainty. My passion for technology and startup experience has equipped me with a unique skill set that I can bring to any organization.  


Startups I joined: 
  - **Go Check Media Pvt Ltd, Education media, Bengaluru:**  My office was in a co-working place. There were 24 startups on a single floor. My team comprised four people. It was figuring out its business model when I joined it as an intern in 2018. My task was to extract education-related articles from the web. I completed the task within the defined timeline of 2 months. I also made the API public on HEROKU.  

  - **Startwithsquare1, Ecommerce platform, Gurugram (Remote)**: I came back to college after finishing my first internship. I joined a local co-working place to continue the routine and hoped to find a new opportunity. Fortunately found another internship during my final semester. I joined to learn to manage large-scale Python projects by working on an e-commerce project.  

  - **Nebularc Technologies Pvt. Ltd., Supply Chain Visibility, Gurugram**: This experience was my first job as a Founding Engineer focusing on computer vision. I worked on multiple problem statements. I did POC on 3d mapping of the containers in the shipping yard. Secondly, I used computer vision to register the container serial entering the inland container depot. Thus cutting down the containers registration time by the factor of 10.

  - **Oleic Technologies Pvt. Ltd., Engagement through games, Bangalore**: Oleic was my first owned startup with my college friend. In comparison to the global market, the hypercasual game market in India is still relatively small, but it is rapidly growing. The revenue generated from hypercasual games in India was around $120 million in 2020, and we can expect it to reach $943 million by 2025, with a CAGR of around 50%. Seeing the projections, we tapped this opportunity. So far, oleic has six renowned customers across multiple sectors. 

> I desire to work with startups until I find a successful product-market fit journey.
