#### At the end of this post you'll be able to understand

- How to write clean code to create classes.
- How to get human readable `__repr__` for classes.
- How to create dummy objects easily for testing purposes.

##### Let's get started

[Python](https://www.python.org) 🐍 has been known for its simplicity.

Just like


You can define a class in python 🐍 in just a couple of lines of code. 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻


```python
class SimpleClass:
    pass
```


Still devs figure out more ways to make it even simpler than ever before.


Let's say you've a vehicle and you want to put it to the test.

A vehicle 🚘 can have certain attributes like an id and *load_capacity* 💰 as mentioned below 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻.


```python
class VehicleSimple:
    def __init__(self, id, load_capacity):
        self.id = id
        self.load_capacity = load_capacity
```



You notice that it's just the class definition and you have repeated word *id* and *load_capacity* thrice 😲.


Isn't it too much work 🤔 ? Can't you do better ❓


Of course you can, because there's always a better way !!


🙇🏻‍♂️ Thanks to [Hynek Schlawack](https://hynek.me) for maintaining [attrs](http://attrs.org) library 📚. It further enhances the code simplicity by reducing boilerplate code. 

Let's install attrs first. 

```bash{outputLines: 1}
pip install attrs
```


Writing 📝 a quick code snippet to use it. 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻


```python
import attr
@attr.s
class VehicleUsingAttr:
    id = attr.ib()
    load_capacity = attr.ib()
```


#### Here you've done three things to put attrs into effect: 

1. **Used `@attr.s` class decorator 🎄.**
2. **Used `attr.ib()` as attributes' value.**
3. **Removed `__init__` method instead of typing *id* and _load_ 3 times 😌.**


Going further you'd instantiate class like this 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻.


```python
test_vehicle_simple = VehicleSimple(id=1, load_capacity=600)
test_vehicle_attrs = VehicleUsingAttr(id=2, load_capacity=600)
```


You can see there's no difference in the way you instantiate the class.

Let's test the console outputs 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻


```python
print(test_vehicle_simple)
# Out: <__main__.VehicleSimple object at 0x7f8a7c973d10>
```

😕 Gibberish 🤷🏻‍♂️ `__repr__`.

```python
print(test_vehicle_attrs)
# Out: VehicleUsingAttr(id=2, load_capacity=600)
```

Nice 👀looking `__repr__` for humans. Isn't that amazing ‼️

#### Things we achived:

1. **Reduced boilerplate code.**
2. **Eased the implementation.**
3. **A nice looking comprehensible `__repr__`.**

I know you're an experienced developer and working on a project which still lacks the real world data to be fed in. So you instantiate your class and make a vehicle 🚘 object with sensible random data.

Suppose for testing purpose you need hundreds 💯 of such vehicle 🚘 objects. So you define two functions which randomly generates sane data. 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻


```python
import random
def random_vehicle_id():
    return random.randint(1, 1000)
def random_load():
    return random.randint(100,1000)
```

Now you create your objects with the dummy 🕶 data using these functions 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻

```python
def get_random_vehicle():
    return VehicleSimple(
        id=random_vehicle_id(),
        load_capacity=random_load()
)
test_100_v = [get_random_vehicle() for _ in range(100)]
```

Now you have 100 💯 vehicles in hand for the testing purpose. We can move ahead and carry out your testing without having the real world 🌍 data in hand.

But you know *attrs* can make it further easy for you !
Wait what ? Yep!

Let's see how


`attr.ib`'s `factory` argument takes callable and instantiate your vehicle with dummy data.


As simple as 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻

```python
import attr
@attr.s
class VehicleUsingAttrs:
    id = attr.ib(factory=lambda: random.randint(1,1000))
    load_capacity = attr.ib(factory=lambda: random.randint(100,1000)) 
test_100_v = [VehicleUsingAttrs() for _ in range(100)]
```

That's how you create dummy objects like a senior dev. 😎


#### Key takeaways: 
1. `@attr.s` class decorator makes the class definition simple and precise.
2. Gives you a nice human 🤓 readable `__repr__` that further helps in debugging 🐞🔫.
3. Helps you to create dummy objects with using callable during testing.
4. Simply you can create and test class objects on the fly ✈️ and use anywhere 💃🏻.
